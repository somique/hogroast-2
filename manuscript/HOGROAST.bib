  abstract = {Antibodies are a key component of the immune system and have been extensively used as biotherapeutics. Accurate knowledge of their structure is central to understanding their antigen-binding function. The key area for antigen binding and the main area of structural variation in antibodies are concentrated in the six complementarity determining regions (CDRs), with the most important for binding and most variable being the CDR-H3 loop. The sequence and structural variability of CDR-H3 make it particularly challenging to model. Recently deep learning methods have offered a step change in our ability to predict protein structures.In this work, we present ABlooper, an end-to-end equivariant deep learning-based CDR loop structure prediction tool. ABlooper rapidly predicts the structure of CDR loops with high accuracy and provides a confidence estimate for each of its predictions. On the models of the Rosetta Antibody Benchmark, ABlooper makes predictions with an average CDR-H3 RMSD of 2.49\,{\AA}, which drops to 2.05\,{\AA} when considering only its 75\% most confident predictions.https://github.com/oxpig/ABlooper.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Immune receptor proteins play a key role in the immune system and have shown great promise as biotherapeutics. The structure of these proteins is critical for understanding their antigen binding properties. Here, we present ImmuneBuilder, a set of deep learning models trained to accurately predict the structure of antibodies (ABodyBuilder2), nanobodies (NanoBodyBuilder2) and T-Cell receptors (TCRBuilder2). We show that ImmuneBuilder generates structures with state of the art accuracy while being far faster than AlphaFold2. For example, on a benchmark of 34 recently solved antibodies, ABodyBuilder2 predicts CDR-H3 loops with an RMSD of 2.81{\AA}, a 0.09{\AA} improvement over AlphaFold-Multimer, while being over a hundred times faster. Similar results are also achieved for nanobodies, (NanoBodyBuilder2 predicts CDR-H3 loops with an average RMSD of 2.89{\AA}, a 0.55{\AA} improvement over AlphaFold2) and TCRs. By predicting an ensemble of structures, ImmuneBuilder also gives an error estimate for every residue in its final prediction. ImmuneBuilder is made freely available, both to download (https://github.com/oxpig/ImmuneBuilder) and to use via our webserver (http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/newsabdab/sabpred). We also make available structural models for {\textasciitilde}150 thousand non-redundant paired antibody sequences (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7258553).},

  abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-17A is a key driver of inflammation and the principal target of anti-IL-17 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. IL-17A, and its structurally similar family member IL-17F, have been shown to be functionally dysregulated in certain human immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis. Given the overlapping biology of these two cytokines, we postulated that dual neutralization of IL-17A and IL-17F may provide a greater depth of clinical response in IL-17-mediated diseases than IL-17A inhibition alone. We identified 496.g1, a humanized antibody with strong affinity for IL-17A but poor affinity for IL-17F. Affinity maturation of 496.g1 to 496.g3 greatly enhanced the affinity of the Fab fragment for IL-17F while retaining strong binding to IL-17A. As an IgG1, the affinity for IL-17A and IL-17F was 3.2 pM and 23 pM, respectively. Comparison of 496.g3 IgG1 with the commercially available anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies ixekizumab and secukinumab, by surface plasmon resonance and in a human in vitro IL-17A functional assay, showed that 496.g3 and ixekizumab display equivalent affinity for IL-17A, and that both antibodies are markedly more potent than secukinumab. In contrast to ixekizumab and secukinumab, 496.g3 exhibited the unique feature of also being able to neutralize the biological activity of IL-17F. Therefore, antibody 496.g3 was selected for clinical development for its ability to neutralize the biologic function of both IL-17A and IL-17F and was renamed bimekizumab (formerly UCB4940). Early clinical data in patients with psoriasis, in those with psoriatic arthritis, and from the Phase 2 studies in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, are encouraging and support the targeted approach of dual neutralization of IL-17A and IL-17F. Taken together, these findings provide the rationale for the continued clinical evaluation of bimekizumab in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.},

  abstract = {Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), also known as ThermoFluor or Thermal Shift Assay, has become a commonly-used approach for detecting protein-ligand interactions, particularly in the context of fragment screening. Upon binding to a folded protein, most ligands stabilize the protein; thus, observing an increase in the temperature at which the protein unfolds as a function of ligand concentration can serve as evidence of a direct interaction. While experimental protocols for this assay are well-developed, it is not straightforward to extract binding constants from the resulting data. Because of this, DSF is often used to probe for an interaction, but not to quantify the corresponding binding constant (Kd). Here, we propose a new approach for analyzing DSF data. Using unfolding curves at varying ligand concentrations, our ``isothermal'' approach collects from these the fraction of protein that is folded at a single temperature (chosen to be temperature near the unfolding transition). This greatly simplifies the subsequent analysis, because it circumvents the complicating temperature dependence of the binding constant; the resulting constant-temperature system can then be described as a~pair of coupled equilibria (protein folding/unfolding and ligand binding/unbinding). The temperature at which the binding constants are determined can also be tuned, by adding chemical denaturants that shift the protein unfolding temperature. We demonstrate the application of this isothermal analysis using experimental data for maltose binding protein binding to maltose, and for two carbonic anhydrase isoforms binding to each of four inhibitors. To facilitate adoption of this new approach, we provide a free and easy-to-use Python program that analyzes thermal unfolding data and implements the isothermal approach described herein (https://sourceforge.net/projects/dsf-fitting).},

Because of their low molecular weight, sdAbs have advantages with respect to production and delivery to their targets and for applications such as antibody drugs and biosensors. Thus, sdAbs with high thermal stability are required. In this work, we chose seven sdAbs, which have a wide range of melting temperature (T m) values and known structures. We applied molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to estimate their relative stability and compared them with the experimental data. High-temperature MD simulations at 400 K and 500 K were executed with simulations at 300 K as a control. The fraction of native atomic contacts, Q, measured for the 400 K simulations showed a fairly good correlation with the T m values. Interestingly, when the residues were classified by their hydrophobicity and size, the Q values of hydrophilic residues exhibited an even better correlation, suggesting that stabilization is correlated with favorable interactions of hydrophilic residues. Measuring the Q value on a per-residue level enabled us to identify residues that contribute significantly to the instability and thus demonstrating how our analysis can be used in a mutant case study.},

  abstract = {The efficient large scale production of recombinant proteins depends on the careful conditioning of the protein as it is isolated and purified to homogeneity. Low protein stability leads to low purification yields as a result of protein degradation, precipitation and folding instability. It is often necessary to go through several iterations of trial-and-error to optimize the homogeneity, stability and solubility of the protein sample. We have set up Thermofluor assays to identify customized protocols for the preparation and characterization of individual protein constructs. We apply a two-step approach: we first screen for global parameters, followed by a search for protein-specific additives. The first screen has been designed in such a way, that it is possible to discern global stability trends according to pH, salt concentration, buffer type and concentration. The second screen contains small molecules that can affect the folding, aggregation state and solubility of the protein construct and also includes small molecules that specifically bind and stabilize proteins. The screens are designed to evaluate purification and storage protocols, and aim to provide hints to optimize these protocols. The home-made screens have been tested on more than 200 different protein constructs at the Sample Preparation and Characterization (SPC) facility at EMBL Hamburg. We describe which RT-PCR machines can be adapted to perform Thermofluor assays, what are the necessary experimental conditions to set up a screen, some leads on how to interpret the data and we give several examples of Thermofluor applications beyond stability screens.},

Recent remarkable advancements in geometric deep learning have led to unprecedented progress in three-dimensional (3D) generation of ligands that can bind to the protein pocket. However, most existing methods primarily focus on modeling the geometric information of ligands in 3D space. Consequently, these methods fail to consider that the binding of proteins and ligands is a phenomenon driven by intrinsic physicochemical principles. Motivated by this understanding, we propose PIDiff, a model for generating molecules by accounting in the physicochemical principles of protein--ligand binding. Our model learns not only the structural information of proteins and ligands but also to minimize the binding free energy between them. To evaluate the proposed model, we introduce an experimental framework that surpasses traditional assessment methods by encompassing various essential aspects for the practical application of generative models to actual drug development. The results confirm that our model outperforms baseline models on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark dataset, demonstrating its superiority. Through diverse experiments, we have illustrated the promising potential of the proposed model in practical drug development.},

Previous protein bench-marks (including The Critical Assessment of Function Annotation [33], Tasks Assessing Protein Embeddings [23], and FLIP [6]) examine fitness and mutational landscapes across many protein families, but they either exclude antibody data or use very little of it. In light of this, we present the Fitness Landscape for Antibodies (FLAb), the largest therapeutic antibody design benchmark to date. FLAb currently encompasses six properties of therapeutic antibodies: (1) expression, (2) thermosta-bility, (3) immunogenicity, (4) aggregation, (5) polyreactivity, and (6) binding affinity. We use FLAb to assess the performance of various widely adopted, pretrained, deep learning models for proteins (IgLM [28], AntiBERTy [26], ProtGPT2 [11], ProGen2 [21], ProteinMPNN [7], and ESM-IF [13]); and compare them to physics-based Rosetta [1]. Overall, no models are able to correlate with all properties or across multiple datasets of similar properties, indicating that more work is needed in prediction of antibody fitness. Additionally, we elucidate how wild type origin, deep learning architecture, training data composition, parameter size, and evolutionary signal affect performance, and we identify which fitness landscapes are more readily captured by each protein model. To promote an expansion on therapeutic antibody design benchmarking, all FLAb data are freely accessible and open for additional contribution at https://github.com/Graylab/FLAb.},

These STABs should be useful in environmental diagnostics and remediation, and may provide a generic approach for stabilizing antibody fragments in formulations containing detergents and penetrants for topical application in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.},

  abstract = {The binding site of an antibody is formed between the two variable domains, VH and VL, of its antigen binding fragment (Fab). Understanding how VH and VL orientate with respect to one another is important both for studying the mechanisms of antigen specificity and affinity and improving antibody modelling, docking and engineering. Different VH--VL orientations are commonly described using relative measures such as root-mean-square deviation. Recently, the orientation has also been characterised using the absolute measure of a VH--VL packing angle. However, a single angle cannot fully describe all modes of orientation. Here, we present a method which fully characterises VH--VL orientation in a consistent and absolute sense using five angles (HL, HC1, LC1, HC2 and LC2) and a distance (dc). Additionally, we provide a computational tool, ABangle, to allow the VH--VL orientation for any antibody to be automatically calculated and compared with all other known structures. We compare previous studies and show how the modes of orientation being identified relate to movements of different angles. Thus, we are able to explain why different studies identify different structural clusters and different residues as important. Given this result, we then identify those positions and their residue identities which influence each of the angular measures of orientation. Finally, by analysing VH--VL orientation in bound and unbound forms, we find that antibodies specific for protein antigens are significantly more flexible in their unbound form than antibodies specific for hapten antigens.

Therefore, structural and functional characterization, in particular of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), is crucial to the design and engineering of antibodies with unique binding properties. Various studies have focused on classifying the CDR loops into a small set of main-chain conformations to facilitate antibody design by assuming that certain sequences can only adopt a limited number of conformations. Here, we present a kinetic classification of CDR loop structures as ensembles in solution. Using molecular dynamics simulations in combination with strong experimental structural information, we observe conformational transitions between canonical clusters and additional dominant solution structures in the micro-to-millisecond timescale for all CDR loops, independent of length and sequence composition. Besides identifying all relevant conformations in solution, our results revealed that various canonical cluster medians actually belong to the same kinetic minimum. Additionally, we reconstruct the kinetics and probabilities of the conformational transitions between canonical clusters, and thereby extend the model of static canonical structures to reveal a dynamic conformational ensemble in solution as a new paradigm in the field of antibody structure design., Abbreviations: CDR: Complementary-determining region; Fv: Antibody variable fragment; PCCA: Perron cluster analysis; tICA: Time-lagged independent component analysis; VH: Heavy chain variable region; VL: Light chain variable region},

The results clearly indicate that the inherently flexible CDR-H3 loop indeed needs to be characterized as a conformational ensemble. The conformational changes of the CDR-H3 loop in all antibodies investigated follow the paradigm of conformation selection, because we observe the experimentally determined binding competent conformation without the presence of the antigen within the ensemble of pre-existing conformational states in solution before binding. We also demonstrate for several examples that the conformation observed in the antibody crystal structure without antigen present is actually selected to bind the carboxyterminal tail region of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab). Thus, special care must be taken when characterizing antibody CDR-H3 loops by Fab X-ray structures, and the possibility that pre-existing conformations are present should always be considered.},

Additionally, we used classic molecular dynamics simulations to describe nano- to microsecond flexibility and to estimate up to millisecond kinetics of captured conformational transitions. The methodology represents the antibodies as conformational ensembles and allows comprehensive analysis of structural diversity, thermodynamics of conformations and kinetics of structural transitions.

  abstract = {e14507Background: AU-007 is a computationally designed mAb that binds to IL-2 on its CD25 binding epitope. AU-007 bound IL-2 (A/IL-2) cannot bind to trimeric (CD25, CD122, CD132) IL-2 receptors (IL-2R) on Tregs, vascular endothelium, or eosinophils, but IL-2's binding to dimeric IL-2Rs (CD122, CD132) on T effector and NK cells is unhindered. AU-007 thus redirects endogenous or exogenous IL-2 (aldesleukin) towards T effector and NK cell activation, while diminishing immunosuppressive Treg activation and vascular leak. Unique in the IL-2 field, AU-007 can redirect endogenous IL-2 generated from A/IL-2 driven T effector cell expansion in vivo, converting a Treg-mediated autoinhibitory loop into an immune stimulating loop. A/IL-2 is expected to prolong the 85-minute T1/2 of IL-2, allowing endogenous IL-2 (as A/IL-2) or low dose aldesleukin to initiate an anti-tumor response. Methods: This first-in-human Phase 1 study consists of 3 dose escalation arms, each starting with one 1+2 cohort followed by 3+3 cohorts. Arm 1A evaluates escalating doses of monotherapy AU-007 (intravenous, every 2 weeks [Q2W]). Arm 1B evaluates AU-007 (Q2W) plus 1 loading dose of subcutaneous, low dose aldesleukin with the 1st AU-007 dose. The AU-007 dose will be fixed with escalating aldesleukin doses in sequential cohorts. Arm 1C evaluates AU-007 plus escalating doses of concomitant subcutaneous, low dose aldesleukin, both Q2W. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period is the first 28 days of the 1st cycle. Tumor assessments by computed tomography scan occur with each 8-week cycle. The AU-007 and aldesleukin dose and schedule for Phase 2 expansion will be based on safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD). Results: As of 01 February 2023, 8 patients have been enrolled into the first 3 Cohorts of Arm 1A (0.5, 1.5, and 4.5 mg/kg AU-007). AU-007 was well tolerated with no DLTs and all treatment-related adverse events were Grade 1. These occurred in 3 patients, 1 at each dose level. The 4th Cohort of Arm 1A (9 mg/kg AU-007) and the 1st Cohort of Arm 1B (4.5 mg/kg AU-007 + 1 aldesleukin dose of 15,000 IU/kg) are now being evaluated. Three of 4 tumor evaluable patients had a best response of stable disease and 2 continue treatment. Two patients discontinued with objective progression and one with clinical progression. Initial PK data (0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg) demonstrate dose proportional AU-007 serum concentrations with typical characteristics of an IgG1 human mAb. All 7 patients with available PD data demonstrate overall decreasing Tregs (\% change and absolute) and eosinophils, which both express the trimeric IL-2 receptor. Conclusions: AU-007 monotherapy at doses up to 4.5 mg/kg Q2W is safe and well tolerated, with initial signs of immune modulation consistent with AU-007's mechanism of action. These findings warrant continued escalation and combination with aldesleukin. Clinical trial information: NCT05267626.}

  abstract = {Over the last three decades, the appeal for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as therapeutics has been steadily increasing as evident with FDA's recent landmark approval of the 100th mAb. Unlike mAbs that bind to single targets, multispecific biologics (msAbs) have garnered particular interest owing to the advantage of engaging distinct targets. One important modular component of msAbs is the single-chain variable fragment (scFv). Despite the exquisite specificity and affinity of these scFv modules, their relatively poor thermostability often hampers their development as a potential therapeutic drug. In recent years, engineering antibody sequences to enhance their stability by mutations has gained considerable momentum. As experimental methods for antibody engineering are time-intensive, laborious and expensive, computational methods serve as a fast and inexpensive alternative to conventional routes. In this work, we show two machine learning approaches -- one with pre-trained language models (PTLM) capturing functional effects of sequence variation, and second, a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with Rosetta energetic features -- to better classify thermostable scFv variants from sequence. Both of these models are trained over temperature-specific data (TS50 measurements) derived from multiple libraries of scFv sequences. On out-of-distribution (refers to the fact that the out-of-distribution sequnes are blind to the algorithm) sequences, we show that a sufficiently simple CNN model performs better than general pre-trained language models trained on diverse protein sequences (average Spearman correlation coefficient, {$\rho$}, of 0.4 as opposed to 0.15). On the other hand, an antibody-specific language model performs comparatively better than the CNN model on the same task ({$\rho$}= 0.52). Further, we demonstrate that for an independent mAb with available thermal melting temperatures for 20 experimentally characterized thermostable mutations, these models trained on TS50 data could identify 18 residue positions and 5 identical amino-acid mutations showing remarkable generalizability. Our results suggest that such models can be broadly applicable for improving the biological characteristics of antibodies. Further, transferring such models for alternative physicochemical properties of scFvs can have potential applications in optimizing large-scale production and delivery of mAbs or bsAbs.},

Here we show that pico- to nano-second timescale atomic fluctuations in hinge regions of adenylate kinase facilitate the large-scale, slower lid motions that produce a catalytically competent state. The fast, local mobilities differ between a mesophilic and hyperthermophilic adenylate kinase, but are strikingly similar at temperatures at which enzymatic activity and free energy of folding are matched. The connection between different timescales and the corresponding amplitudes of motions in adenylate kinase and their linkage to catalytic function is likely to be a general characteristic of protein energy landscapes.},

  abstract = {Atomistic resolution is considered the standard for high-resolution biomolecular structures, but coarse-grained models are often necessary to reflect limited experimental resolution or to achieve feasibility in computational studies. It is generally assumed that reduced representations involve a loss of detail, accuracy, and transferability. This study explores the use of advanced machine-learning networks to learn from known structures of proteins how to reconstruct atomistic models from reduced representations to assess how much information is lost when the vast knowledge about protein structures is taken into account. The main finding is that highly accurate and stereochemically realistic all-atom structures can be recovered with minimal loss of information from just a single bead per amino acid residue, especially when placed at the side chain center of mass. High-accuracy reconstructions with better than 1 {\AA} heavy atom root-mean square deviations are still possible when only C{$\alpha$} coordinates are used as input. This suggests that lower-resolution representations are essentially sufficient to represent protein structures when combined with a machine-learning framework that encodes knowledge from known structures. Practical applications of this high-accuracy reconstruction scheme are illustrated for adding atomistic detail to low-resolution structures from experiment or coarse-grained models generated from computational modeling. Moreover, a rapid, deterministic all-atom reconstruction scheme allows the implementation of an efficient multi-scale framework. As a demonstration, the rapid refinement of accurate models against cryoEM densities is shown where sampling at the coarse-grained level is guided by map correlation functions applied at the atomistic level. With this approach, the accuracy of standard all-atom simulation based refinement schemes can be matched at a fraction of the computational cost. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE The fundamental insight of this work is that atomistic detail of proteins can be recovered with minimal loss of information from highly reduced representations with just a single bead per amino acid residue. This is possible by encoding the existing knowledge about protein structures in a machine-learning model. This suggests that it is not strictly necessary to resolve structures in atomistic detail in experiments, computational modeling, or the generation of protein conformations via neural networks since atomistic details can inferred quickly via the neural network. This increases the relevance of experimental structures obtained at lower resolutions and broadens the impact of coarse-grained modeling.},

Although the derivation of the algorithm is presented in terms of matrices, no matrix matrix multiplications are needed and only the nonzero matrix elements have to be stored, making the method useful for very large molecules.

However, our model, like previous methods, appears to be overtraining on the few hundred experimental data points available and performance is not robust to train--test cut-offs. To investigate the amount and type of data required to generalizably predict {$\Delta\Delta$}G, we built synthetic datasets of nearly 1 million FoldX-generated and {$>$}20,000 Rosetta Flex ddG-generated {$\Delta\Delta$}G values. Our results indicate that there are currently insufficient experimental data to accurately and robustly predict {$\Delta\Delta$}G, with orders of magnitude more likely needed. Dataset size is not the only consideration; diversity is also an important factor for model predictiveness. These findings provide a lower bound on data requirements to inform future method development and data collection efforts.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, therapeutic antibodies have emerged as a rapidly expanding domain within the field of biologics. In silico tools that can streamline the process of antibody discovery and optimization are critical to support a pipeline that is growing more numerous and complex every year. High-quality structural information remains critical for the antibody optimization process, but antibody-antigen complex structures are often unavailable and in silico antibody docking methods are still unreliable. In this study, DeepAb, a deep learning model for predicting antibody Fv structure directly from sequence, was used in conjunction with single-point experimental deep mutational scanning (DMS) enrichment data to design 200 potentially optimized variants of an anti-hen egg lysozyme (HEL) antibody. We sought to determine whether DeepAb-designed variants containing combinations of beneficial mutations from the DMS exhibit enhanced thermostability and whether this optimization affected their developability profile. The 200 variants were produced through a robust high-throughput method and tested for thermal and colloidal stability (Tonset, Tm, Tagg), affinity (KD) relative to the parental antibody, and for developability parameters (nonspecific binding, aggregation propensity, self-association). Of the designed clones, 91\% and 94\% exhibited increased thermal and colloidal stability and affinity, respectively. Of these, 10\% showed a significantly increased affinity for HEL (5- to 21-fold increase) and thermostability ({$>$}2.5C increase in Tm1), with most clones retaining the favorable developability profile of the parental antibody. Additional in silico tests suggest that these methods would enrich for binding affinity even without first collecting experimental DMS measurements. These data open the possibility of in silico antibody optimization without the need to predict the antibody--antigen interface, which is notoriously difficult in the absence of crystal structures.},

  abstract = {In addition to binding to a desired target molecule, all antibody drugs must also meet a set of criteria regarding the feasibility of their manufacture, stability in storage, and absence of off-target stickiness. This suite of characteristics is often termed ``developability.'' We present here a comprehensive analysis of these properties for essentially the full set of antibody drugs that have been tested in phase-2 or -3 clinical trials, or are approved by the FDA. Surprisingly, many of the drugs or candidates in this set exhibit properties that indicate significant developability risks; however, the number of such red warning flags decreases with advancement toward approval. This reference dataset should help prioritize future drug candidates for development., Antibodies are a highly successful class of biological drugs, with over 50 such molecules approved for therapeutic use and hundreds more currently in clinical development. Improvements in technology for the discovery and optimization of high-potency antibodies have greatly increased the chances for finding binding molecules with desired biological properties; however, achieving drug-like properties at the same time is an additional requirement that is receiving increased attention. In this work, we attempt to quantify the historical limits of acceptability for multiple biophysical metrics of ``developability.'' Amino acid sequences from 137 antibodies in advanced clinical stages, including 48 approved for therapeutic use, were collected and used to construct isotype-matched IgG1 antibodies, which were then expressed in mammalian cells. The resulting material for each source antibody was evaluated in a dozen biophysical property assays. The distributions of the observed metrics are used to empirically define boundaries of drug-like behavior that can represent practical guidelines for future antibody drug candidates.},

Several high-throughput in vitro assays and in silico approaches have been proposed to de-risk antibodies during early stages of the discovery process. In this review, we have compiled and collectively analyzed published experimental assessments and computational metrics for clinical antibodies. We show that flags assigned based on in vitro measurements of polyspecificity and hydrophobicity are more predictive of clinical progression than their in silico counterparts. Additionally, we assessed the performance of published models for developability predictions on molecules not used during model training. We find that generalization to data outside of those used for training remains a challenge for models. Finally, we highlight the challenges of reproducibility in computed metrics arising from differences in homology modeling, in vitro assessments relying on complex reagents, as well as curation of experimental data often used to assess the utility of high-throughput approaches. We end with a recommendation to enable assay reproducibility by inclusion of controls with disclosed sequences, as well as sharing of structural models to enable the critical assessment and improvement of in silico predictions.},

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18\% overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen--oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self-diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.}

The present article reports on a fast-track assessment platform for rapid investigation of therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with minimal sample concentration, volume, and preparation. The proposed nanoDSF platform has been demonstrated for rapid assessment of two commercial IgG 1 drug products (DP), trastuzumab and rituximab, and their biosimilars with respect to their conformational and colloidal stability. Domain specific differences for each of the IgGs have been elucidated with respect to onset of domain unfolding (Tonset) and melting temperatures. These thermal unfolding and transition midpoint (Tm) measurements are based on the intrinsic aromatic amino acid residue fluorescence of proteins. Moreover, to understand the possibility of nanoDSF as a predictive tool, data from nanoDSF has been correlated with accelerated stability studies. Melting temperatures across brands were found to be highly comparable to the rate of heating, thereby exhibiting a significant domain specific effect on melting temperatures for both trastuzumab and rituximab. Conservation of higher order structure (HOS) through reversible unfolding was also examined and both the mAbs were found to regain tertiary structure up till the first transition midpoint. No clear correlation was found between formation of higher molecular weight species (HMWS) and unfolding parameters (Tonset and Tagg) for accelerated stability studies. Finally, a discussion on the need for fast predictive assessment of conformation and colloidal stability as well as a comparison of advantages and limitations of the technique with routine/classical tools such as circular dichroism spectrophotometry and differential scanning calorimetry has been presented.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1--4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence---the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8---has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10--14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

A hybrid AA/CG scheme based on combining all-atom CHARMM and coarse-grained PRIMO representations was validated via molecular dynamics and replica exchange simulations of soluble and membrane proteins. The AA/CG scheme was also tested in the calculation of the free energy profile for the transition from the closed to the open state of adenylate kinase via umbrella sampling molecular dynamics method. The overall finding is that the AA/CG scheme generates dynamics and energetics that is qualitatively and quantitatively comparable to AA simulations while offering the computational advantages of coarse-graining.

The discovery of antibodies that bind to particular targets with high affinity is now a routine exercise and a variety of in vitro and in vivo techniques are available for this purpose. However, it is still challenging to identify antibodies that, in addition to having the desired biological effect, also express well, remain soluble at different pH levels, remain stable at high concentrations, can withstand high shear stress, and have minimal non-specific interactions. Many promising antibody programs have ultimately failed in development due to the problems associated with one of these factors. Here, we present a simple high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based screening method to assess these developability factors earlier in discovery process. This method is robust and requires only microgram quantities of proteins. Briefly, we show that for antibodies injected on a commercially available pre-packed Zenix HPLC column, the retention times are inversely related to their colloidal stability with antibodies prone to precipitation or aggregation retained longer on the column with broader peaks. By simply varying the salt content of running buffer, we were also able to estimate the nature of interactions between the antibodies and the column. We believe this approach should generally be applicable to assessment of the developability of other classes of bio-therapeutic molecules, and that the addition of this simple tool early in the discovery process will lead to selection of molecules with improved developability characteristics.},

  abstract = {Ongoing advances in force field and computer hardware development enable the use of molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate increasingly complex systems with the ultimate goal of reaching cellular complexity. At the same time, rational design by high-throughput (HT) simulations is another forefront of MD. In these areas, the Martini coarse-grained force field, especially the latest version (i.e. v3), is being actively explored because it offers an enhanced spatial-temporal resolution. However, the automation tools for preparing simulations with the Martini force field, accompanying the previous version, were not designed for HT simulations or studies of complex cellular systems. Therefore, they become a major limiting factor. To address these shortcomings, we present the open-source Vermouth python library. Vermouth is designed to become the unified framework for developing programs, which prepare, run, and analyze Martini simulations of complex systems. To demonstrate the power of the Vermouth library, the Martinize2 program is showcased as a generalization of the martinize script, originally aimed to set up simulations of proteins. In contrast to the previous version, Martinize2 automatically handles protonation states in proteins and post-translation modifications, offers more options to fine-tune structural biases such as the elastic network (EN), and can convert non-protein molecules such as ligands. Finally, Martinize2 is used in two high-complexity benchmarks. The entire I-TASSER protein template database as well as a subset of 200,000 structures from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database are converted to CG resolution and we illustrate how the checks on input structure quality can safeguard high-throughput applications.},

  abstract = {Long-term stability of monoclonal antibodies to be used as biologics is a key aspect in their development. Therefore, its possible early prediction from accelerated stability studies is of major interest, despite currently being regarded as not sufficiently robust. In this work, using a combination of accelerated stability studies (up to 6~months) and first order degradation kinetic model, we are able to predict the long-term stability (up to 3~years) of multiple monoclonal antibody formulations. More specifically, we can robustly predict the long-term stability behaviour of a protein at the intended storage condition (5~{$^\circ$}C), based on up to six months of data obtained for multiple quality attributes from different temperatures, usually from intended (5~{$^\circ$}C), accelerated (25~{$^\circ$}C) and stress conditions (40~{$^\circ$}C). We have performed stability studies and evaluated the stability data of several mAbs including IgG1, IgG2, and fusion proteins, and validated our model by overlaying the 95\% prediction interval and experimental stability data from up to 36~months. We demonstrated improved robustness, speed and accuracy of kinetic long-term stability prediction as compared to classical linear extrapolation used today, which justifies long-term stability prediction and shelf-life extrapolation for some biologics such as monoclonal antibodies. This work aims to contribute towards further development and refinement of the regulatory landscape that could steer toward allowing extrapolation for biologics during the developmental phase, clinical phase, and also in marketing authorisation applications, as already established today for small molecules.},

  abstract = {Following the sequence and structure revolutions, predicting the dynamical mechanisms of proteins that implement biological function remains an outstanding scientific challenge. Several experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can, in principle, determine conformational states, binding configurations and their probabilities, but suffer from low throughput. Here we develop a Biomolecular Emulator (BioEmu), a generative deep learning system that can generate thousands of statistically independent samples from the protein structure ensemble per hour on a single graphical processing unit. By leveraging novel training methods and vast data of protein structures, over 200 milliseconds of MD simulation, and experimental protein stabilities, BioEmu's protein ensembles represent equilibrium in a range of challenging and practically relevant metrics. Qualitatively, BioEmu samples many functionally relevant conformational changes, ranging from formation of cryptic pockets, over unfolding of specific protein regions, to large-scale domain rearrangements. Quantitatively, BioEmu samples protein conformations with relative free energy errors around 1 kcal/mol, as validated against millisecond-timescale MD simulation and experimentally-measured protein stabilities. By simultaneously emulating structural ensembles and thermodynamic properties, BioEmu reveals mechanistic insights, such as the causes for fold destabilization of mutants, and can efficiently provide experimentally-testable hypotheses.},

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have added considerably to our understanding of folded proteins, but the accuracy with which the force fields used in such simulations can describe disordered proteins is unclear. In this work, using a modern force field, we performed a 200 {$\mu$}s unrestrained MD simulation of the acid-unfolded state of an experimentally well-characterized protein, ACBP, to explore the extent to which state-of-the-art simulation can describe the structural and dynamical features of a disordered protein. By comparing the simulation results with the results of NMR experiments, we demonstrate that the simulation successfully captures important aspects of both the local and global structure. Our simulation was {\textasciitilde}2 orders of magnitude longer than those in previous studies of unfolded proteins, a length sufficient to observe repeated formation and breaking of helical structure, which we found to occur on a multimicrosecond time scale. We observed one structural feature that formed but did not break during the simulation, highlighting the difficulty in sampling disordered states. Overall, however, our simulation results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data, demonstrating that MD simulations can already be useful in describing disordered proteins. Finally, our direct calculation of certain NMR observables from the simulation provides new insight into the general relationship between structural features of disordered proteins and experimental NMR relaxation properties.},

Here we present a systematic and extensive evaluation of eight different protein force fields based on comparisons of experimental data with molecular dynamics simulations that reach a previously inaccessible timescale. First, through extensive comparisons with experimental NMR data, we examined the force fields' abilities to describe the structure and fluctuations of folded proteins. Second, we quantified potential biases towards different secondary structure types by comparing experimental and simulation data for small peptides that preferentially populate either helical or sheet-like structures. Third, we tested the force fields' abilities to fold two small proteins---one {$\alpha$}-helical, the other with {$\beta$}-sheet structure. The results suggest that force fields have improved over time, and that the most recent versions, while not perfect, provide an accurate description of many structural and dynamical properties of proteins.},

  abstract = {The discovery of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to a particular molecular target is now regarded a routine exercise. However, the successful development of mAbs that (1) express well, (2) elicit a desirable biological effect upon binding, and (3) remain soluble and display low viscosity at high concentrations is often far more challenging. Therefore, high throughput screening assays that assess self-association and aggregation early in the selection process are likely to yield mAbs with superior biophysical properties. Here, we report an improved version of affinity-capture self-interaction nanoparticle spectroscopy (AC-SINS) that is capable of screening large panels of antibodies for their propensity to self-associate. AC-SINS is based on concentrating mAbs from dilute solutions around gold nanoparticles pre-coated with polyclonal capture (e.g., anti-Fc) antibodies. Interactions between immobilized mAbs lead to reduced inter-particle distances and increased plasmon wavelengths (wavelengths of maximum absorbance), which can be readily measured by optical means. This method is attractive because it is compatible with dilute and unpurified mAb solutions that are typical during early antibody discovery. In addition, we have improved multiple aspects of this assay for increased throughput and reproducibility. A data set comprising over 400 mAbs suggests that our modified assay yields self-interaction measurements that are well-correlated with other lower throughput assays such as cross-interaction chromatography. We expect that the simplicity and throughput of our improved AC-SINS method will lead to improved selection of mAbs with excellent biophysical properties during early antibody discovery.},

The results from studies applying these tools are, however, dependent on the quality of the force fields used. In particular, accurate treatment of the peptide backbone is crucial to achieve representative conformational distributions in simulation studies. To improve the treatment of the peptide backbone, quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical (MM) calculations were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline dipeptides, and the results from these calculations were combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins in crystal and aqueous environments. QM potential energy maps of the alanine and glycine dipeptides at the LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G* levels, where x = D, T, and Q, were determined, and are compared to available QM studies on these molecules. The LMP2/cc-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G* energy surfaces for all three dipeptides were then used to improve the MM treatment of the dipeptides. These improvements included additional parameter optimization via Monte Carlo simulated annealing and extension of the potential energy function to contain peptide backbone phi, psi dihedral crossterms or a phi, psi grid-based energy correction term. Simultaneously, MD simulations of up to seven proteins in their crystalline environments were used to validate the force field enhancements. Comparison with QM and crystallographic data showed that an additional optimization of the phi, psi dihedral parameters along with the grid-based energy correction were required to yield significant improvements over the CHARMM22 force field. However, systematic deviations in the treatment of phi and psi in the helical and sheet regions were evident. Accordingly, empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based energy correction for alanine and glycine to account for these systematic differences. These adjustments lead to greater deviations from QM data for the two dipeptides but also yielded improved agreement with experimental crystallographic data. These improvements enhance the quality of the CHARMM force field in treating proteins. This extension of the potential energy function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment of biological macromolecules via MM approaches in general.},

A modified human IgG framework has been developed through a combination of engineering approaches, which can be used to stabilize antibodies of diverse specificity. This is achieved through a combination of complementarity-determining region (CDR)-grafting onto the stable framework, mammalian cell display and in vitro somatic hypermutation (SHM). This approach allows both stabilization and maturation to affinities beyond those of the original antibody, as shown by the stabilization of an anti-HA33 antibody by approximately 10{$^\circ$}C and affinity maturation of approximately 300-fold over the original antibody. Specificities of 10 antibodies of diverse origin were successfully transferred to the stable framework through CDR-grafting, with 8 of these successfully stabilized, including the therapeutic antibodies adalimumab, stabilized by 9.9{$^\circ$}C, denosumab, stabilized by 7{$^\circ$}C, cetuximab stabilized by 6.9{$^\circ$}C and to a lesser extent trastuzumab stabilized by 0.8{$^\circ$}C.

Since the goal of this study is to lay out the framework and validate the concept, it focuses on Asp and Glu residues where the protein pKa values and structures are assumed to be more reliable. The new and improved implementation is evaluated and discussed; it is found to agree better with experiment than the previous implementation (in parentheses): rmsd = 0.79 (0.91) for Asp and Glu, 0.75 (0.97) for Tyr, 0.65 (0.72) for Lys, and 1.00 (1.37) for His residues.

  abstract = {Calculating interactions or correlations between pairs of particles is typically the most time-consuming task in particle simulation or correlation analysis. Straightforward implementations using a double loop over particle pairs have traditionally worked well, especially since compilers usually do a good job of unrolling the inner loop. In order to reach high performance on modern CPU and accelerator architectures, single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) parallelization has become essential. Avoiding memory bottlenecks is also increasingly important and requires reducing the ratio of memory to arithmetic operations. Moreover, when pairs only interact within a certain cut-off distance, good SIMD utilization can only be achieved by reordering input and output data, which quickly becomes a limiting factor. Here we present an algorithm for SIMD parallelization based on grouping a fixed number of particles, e.g. 2, 4, or 8, into spatial clusters. Calculating all interactions between particles in a pair of such clusters improves data reuse compared to the traditional scheme and results in a more efficient SIMD parallelization. Adjusting the cluster size allows the algorithm to map to SIMD units of various widths. This flexibility not only enables fast and efficient implementation on current CPUs and accelerator architectures like GPUs or Intel MIC, but it also makes the algorithm future-proof. We present the algorithm with an application to molecular dynamics simulations, where we can also make use of the effective buffering the method introduces.},

Thermostability changes upon mutation originate from modifications of the free energy of unfolding ({$\Delta$}Gu), making thermostabilization extremely challenging to predict with computational methods. In this contribution, we combine global conformational sampling with energy prediction using AlphaFold and Rosetta to develop a new computational protocol for the quantitative prediction of thermostability changes upon laboratory evolution of acyltransferase LovD and lipase LipA. We highlight how using an ensemble of protein conformations rather than a single three-dimensional model is mandatory for accurate thermostability predictions. By comparing our approaches with existing ones, we show that ensembles based on AlphaFold models provide more accurate and robust calculated thermostability trends than ensembles based solely on crystallographic structures as the latter introduce a strong distortion (scaffold bias) in computed thermostabilities. Eliminating this bias is critical for computer-guided enzyme design and evaluating the effect of multiple mutations on protein stability.},

  abstract = {Reliable prediction of protein thermostability from its sequence is valuable for both academic and industrial research. This prediction problem can be tackled using machine learning and by taking advantage of the recent blossoming of deep learning methods for sequence analysis. These methods can facilitate training on more data and, possibly, enable the development of more versatile thermostability predictors for multiple ranges of temperatures.We applied the principle of transfer learning to predict protein thermostability using embeddings generated by protein language models (pLMs) from an input protein sequence. We used large pLMs that were pre-trained on hundreds of millions of known sequences. The embeddings from such models allowed us to efficiently train and validate a high-performing prediction method using over one million sequences that we collected from organisms with annotated growth temperatures. Our method, TemStaPro (Temperatures of Stability for Proteins), was used to predict thermostability of CRISPR-Cas Class II effector proteins (C2EPs). Predictions indicated sharp differences among groups of C2EPs in terms of thermostability and were largely in tune with previously published and our newly obtained experimental data.TemStaPro software and the related data are freely available from https://github.com/ievapudz/TemStaPro and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7743637.},

  abstract = {Understanding protein thermostability is essential for numerous biotechnological applications, but traditional experimental methods are time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. Recently, deep learning (DL) techniques from natural language processing (NLP) was extended to the field of biology, since the primary sequence of proteins can be viewed as a string of amino acids that follow a physicochemical grammar. In this study, we developed TemBERTure, a DL framework that predicts thermostability class and melting temperature from protein sequences. Our findings emphasize the importance of data diversity for training robust models, especially by including sequences from a wider range of organisms. Additionally, we suggest using attention scores from Deep Learning models to gain deeper insights into protein thermostability. Analyzing these scores in conjunction with the 3D protein structure can enhance understanding of the complex interactions among amino acid properties, their positioning, and the surrounding microenvironment. By addressing the limitations of current prediction methods and introducing new exploration avenues, this research paves the way for more accurate and informative protein thermostability predictions, ultimately accelerating advancements in protein engineering.TemBERTure model and the data are available at: https://github.com/ibmm-unibe-ch/TemBERTure.},

PEG-induced protein precipitation has been routinely used to assess protein solubility. To provide insights for better understanding and implementation of PEG-induced protein precipitation assay, this work compares different solubility measures and examines their relevance to loss of protein solubility in concentrated formulations.MethodsSolubility of a MAb in 15 formulations was evaluated using PEG-induced precipitation assay. Three apparent protein solubility measures, the middle-point and onset PEG concentrations (cmid and conset) as well as the binding free energy ({$\mu$}B), were obtained from the PEG-induced protein precipitation assay and compared to the DLS protein interaction parameter (kD). Visual inspection of loss of protein solubility in concentrated formulations during storage was used to further examine the discrepancy of protein solubility ranking by these measures.ResultsPEG-induced precipitation assay predicted overall protein solubility ranking similar to that by DLS kD. However, for three formulations with ionic excipients NaCl, Arg{$\cdot$}Cl, and Arg{$\cdot$}Glu{$\cdot$}Cl, PEG-induced precipitation assay yielded more accurate predictions compared to DLS kD measurements. Furthermore, {$\mu$}B showed superior ability in distinguishing protein solubility for these formulations.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated good correlations between the protein solubility measures obtained from PEG-induced precipitation experiments and DLS kD measurement. It also provides one example in which protein solubility ranking by binding free energy is more accurate than the other measures. The results support the theoretical proposition that {$\mu$}B has a potential to serve as standard protein solubility measure.},

  abstract = {The distortions in the high-order structure of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) under different environmental conditions acutely affect mAb stability, resulting in altered safety, efficacy, and shelf-life profiles. The overall stability of mAbs depends on many factors, and it requires complementary techniques for an in-depth analysis. The stability of mAbs can be characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation (DCS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) techniques. In this report, temperature-ramped dynamic light scattering (DLS), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy were employed as complementary tools to show how temperature and pH affect the aggregation of a model mAb, trastuzumab, in solution. The results showed that the aggregation onset temperature of trastuzumab defined by DLS was 75 {$^\circ$}C, which decreases the amount of {$\beta$}-sheets and causes a slight increase in helix structures. Moreover, the melting temperature of trastuzumab was determined to be between 80--83 {$^\circ$}C by temperature-ramped CD spectrophotometry, which is in line with the Tm of trastuzumab's Fab region tested with DSC. Thus, unfolding and aggregation of trastuzumab start simultaneously at 75 {$^\circ$}C, and unfolding triggers the aggregation. The temperature-ramped CD and DLS methods are robust tools to determine the thermal behavior of biosimilars in various solution conditions. Their complementary usage provides solid scientific background for regulatory applications and a better understanding of mAb instability and its relationship with structural changes.},

  abstract = {Coarse-graining offers a means to extend the achievable time and length scales of molecular dynamics simulations beyond what is practically possible in the atomistic regime. Sampling molecular configurations of interest can be done efficiently using coarse-grained simulations, from which meaningful physicochemical information can be inferred if the corresponding all-atom configurations are reconstructed. However, this procedure of backmapping to reintroduce the lost atomistic detail into coarse-grain structures has proven a challenging task due to the many feasible atomistic configurations that can be associated with one coarse-grain structure. Existing backmapping methods are strictly frame-based, relying on either heuristics to replace coarse-grain particles with atomic fragments and subsequent relaxation, or parameterized models to propose atomic coordinates separately and independently for each coarse-grain structure. These approaches neglect information from previous trajectory frames that is critical to ensuring temporal coherence of the backmapped trajectory, while also offering information potentially helpful to produce higher-fidelity atomic reconstructions. In this work we present a deep learning-enabled data-driven approach for temporally coherent backmapping that explicitly incorporates information from preceding trajectory structures. Our method trains a conditional variational autoencoder to non-deterministically reconstruct atomistic detail conditioned on both the target coarse-grain configuration and the previously reconstructed atomistic configuration. We demonstrate our backmapping approach on two exemplar biomolecular systems: alanine dipeptide and the miniprotein chignolin. We show that our backmapped trajectories accurately recover the structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of the atomistic trajectory data.},

Instead, these models implicitly reason about crucial sidechain interactions based on backbone geometry and known amino acid sequence labels. To address this, we present FAMPNN (Full-Atom MPNN), a sequence design method that explicitly models both sequence identity and sidechain conformation for each residue, where the per-token distribution of a residue's discrete amino acid identity and its continuous sidechain conformation are learned with a combined categorical cross-entropy and diffusion loss objective. We demonstrate that learning these distributions jointly is a highly synergistic task that both improves sequence recovery while achieving state-of-the-art sidechain packing. Furthermore, benefits from explicit full-atom modeling generalize from sequence recovery to practical protein design applications, such as zero-shot prediction of experimental binding and stability measurements.},

We present new algorithms that allow pKa shifts due to inductive (i.e., covalently coupled) intraligand interactions, as well as noncovalently coupled interligand interactions in multiligand complexes, to be included in the prediction. The number of different ligand chemical groups that are automatically recognized has been increased to 18, and the general implementation has been changed so that new functional groups can be added easily by the user, aided by a new and more general protonation scheme. Except for a few cases, the new algorithms in PROPKA3.1 are found to yield results similar to or better than those obtained with PROPKA2.0 (Bas et al. Proteins: Struct., Funct., Bioinf.2008, 73, 765--783). Finally, we present a novel algorithm that identifies noncovalently coupled ionizable groups, where pKa prediction may be especially difficult.

Here, we focus on predicting the structural flexibility of the functionally important antibody and T-cell receptor CDR3 loops. We extracted a dataset of CDR3 like loop motifs from the PDB to create ALL-conformations, a dataset containing 1.2 million structures and more than 100,000 unique sequences.

  abstract = {Antibody-antigen specific recognition is essential in autoimmunity. In this study, antibody SPE7 binding to protein antigens and to hapten molecules were carefully analyzed in order to gain insight into their binding mechanisms. X-ray crystal structures show that SPE7 can adopt at least four different conformations, as in the two observed free isomers (Ab(1) and Ab(2)) and the two observed bound conformers (Ab(3) and Ab(4)). Multidimensional scaling analysis reveals that antibody SPE7 may obey a global conformational selection mechanism upon its binding to an antigen. The conformations of key residue at the binding site (Trp93L) further reveals that bound isomer Ab(3) may come from free isomer Ab(2), and bound isomer Ab(4) from free isomer Ab(1). The average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values between the bound isomers and the corresponding free isomers and Kolmogorov-Smimov P test analysis indicate that the antibody may also follow a local induced fit mechanism at the binding interface. Quantitative analysis indicates that the magnitude of the local induced fit interaction at the binding site is more pronounced than that of the global conformational selection interaction. These conclusions are further supported by high-temperature unbinding kinetics analysis. The computational methods proposed here can also be used to study the specific recognitions between other antibody and antigen systems.},

  abstract = {For simulations of membranes and membrane proteins, the generation of the lipid bilayer is a critical step in the setup of the system. Membranes comprising multiple components pose a particular challenge, because the relative abundances need to be controlled and the equilibration of the system may take several microseconds. Here we present a comprehensive method for building membrane containing systems, characterized by simplicity and versatility. The program uses preset, coarse-grain lipid templates to build the membrane, and also allows on-the-fly generation of simple lipid types by specifying the headgroup, linker, and lipid tails on the command line. The resulting models can be equilibrated, after which a relaxed atomistic model can be obtained by reverse transformation. For multicomponent membranes, this provides an efficient means for generating equilibrated atomistic models. The method is called insane, an acronym for INSert membrANE. The program has been made available, together with the complementary method for reverse transformation, at http://cgmartini.nl/. This work highlights the key features of insane and presents a survey of properties for a large range of lipids as a start of a computational lipidomics project.},

  abstract = {There has been considerable recent progress in designing new proteins using deep-learning methods1--9. Despite this progress, a general deep-learning framework for protein design that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges, including de novo binder design and design of higher-order symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence--structure relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.},

  abstract = {Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) is a method to determine the apparent melting temperature (Tma) of a purified protein. In DSF, the raw unfolding curves from which Tma is calculated vary widely in shape and complexity. However, the tools available for calculating Tma are only compatible with the simplest of DSF curves, hindering many otherwise straightforward applications of the technology. To overcome this limitation, we designed new mathematical models for Tma calculation that accommodate common forms of variation in DSF curves, including the number of transitions, the presence of high initial signal, and temperature-dependent signal decay. When tested these models against DSFbase, an open-source database of 6235 raw, real-life DSF curves, these models outperformed the existing standard approaches of sigmoid fitting and maximum of the first derivative. To make these models accessible, we created an open-source software and website, DSFworld (https://gestwickilab.shinyapps.io/dsfworld/). In addition to these improved fitting capabilities, DSFworld also includes features that overcome the practical limitations of many analysis workflows, including automatic reformatting of raw data exported from common qPCR instruments, labeling of data based on experimental variables, and flexible interactive plotting. We hope that DSFworld will enable more streamlined and accurate calculation of Tma values for DSF experiments.},

  abstract = {To identify amino acids that play important roles in the structural stability of Fab, seven phenylalanine residues in the Fab constant region of the therapeutic antibody adalimumab were subjected to alanine mutagenesis. Six Fab mutants, H:F130A, H:F154A, H:F174A, L:F118A, L:F139A and L:F209A, showed decreased thermostability compared with wild-type Fab. In contrast, the Tm for the L:F116A mutant was 1.7{$^\circ$}C higher than that of wild-type Fab, indicating that the F116 residue was unfavorable for Fab thermostability. Six proline mutants, H:P131G, H:P155G, H:P175G, L:P119G, L:P120G and L:P141G, were also prepared to investigate the effect of proline residues adjacent to mutated phenylalanine residues. The thermostability of the H:P155G and L:P141G mutants in particular was significantly reduced, with decreases in Tm of 5.0 and 3.0{$^\circ$}C, respectively, compared with wild-type Fab. The H:P155 and L:P141 residues have a cis conformation, whereas the other mutated proline residues have a trans conformation. H:P155 and L:P141 had stacking interactions with the H:F154 and L:Y140, respectively, at the interface between the variable and constant regions. It is suggested that the interactions of the aromatic ring with a cis-form proline at the interface between the variable and constant regions is important for stability of Fab.}

So far, we have attempted to introduce a disulfide bond into the Fab fragment to improve its thermal stability and demonstrated that it is possible to do this without sacrificing its biochemical function. In this study, to develop a novel stabilization strategy for Fab, we attempted to introduce a disulfide bond between the variable and constant domains and prepared three variants of Fab; H:G10C~+~H:P210C, L:P40C~+~L:E165C, and H:G10C~+~H:P210C~+~L:P40C~+~L:E165C. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements showed that each of these variants had improved thermal stability. In addition, the variants with two disulfide bonds demonstrated a 6.5~{$^\circ$}C increase in their denaturation temperatures compared to wild-type Fab. The introduction of disulfide bonds was confirmed by X-ray crystallography, and the variants retained their antigen-binding activity. The variants were also found to be less aggregative than the wild type. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of a disulfide bond between the variable and constant domains significantly improves the thermal stability of Fab.},

  abstract = {Proteins play a fundamental role in biology, and their thermostability is essential for their proper functionality. The precise measurement of thermostability is crucial, traditionally relying on resource-intensive experiments. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in protein language models (PLMs), have significantly accelerated the progress in protein thermostability prediction. These models utilize various biological characteristics or deep representations generated by PLMs to represent the protein sequences. However, effectively incorporating structural information, based on the PLM embeddings, while not considering atomic protein structures, remains an open and formidable challenge. Here, we propose a novel Protein Contrast-enhanced Structure-Aware (ProCeSa) model that seamlessly integrates both sequence and structural information extracted from PLMs to enhance thermostability prediction. Our model employs a contrastive learning scheme guided by the categories of amino acid residues, allowing it to discern intricate patterns within protein sequences. Rigorous experiments conducted on publicly available data sets establish the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches, excelling in both classification and regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that ProCeSa addresses the complex challenge of predicting protein thermostability by utilizing PLM-derived sequence embeddings, without requiring access to atomic structural data.},
